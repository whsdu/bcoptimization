action has two dimensions

{-
if we are trying to provide a Domain Specific framework. 

it is always the case that we need to abstract the syntax that can factorize the semantic space. 

the problem is the semantic space is not as rich as we expected, thus the abstraction would bring unnecessary overload. 
(this is why if feels a little bit overkill)

or 

it could be possible that because we do not have a well designed abstraction layer of the syntax , so it stopped us from 
exploring possibly more useful semantics.
